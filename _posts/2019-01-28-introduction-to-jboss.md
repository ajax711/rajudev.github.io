### Introduction to JBOSS Middleware

As per the documentation available for JBOSS on Red Hats [website](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.0/html/getting_started_guide/introduction)

`"Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7 (JBoss EAP) is a middleware platform 
built on open standards and compliant with the Java Enterprise Edition 7 specification."`

Think of it as the the plumbing between your application and the server on which it is hosted.

`"JBoss EAP provides two operating modes for JBoss EAP instances: standalone server or 
managed domain. The standalone server operating mode represents running JBoss EAP as a
single server instance. The managed domain operating mode allows for the management of
multiple JBoss EAP instances from a single control point. "`

`"In addition, JBoss EAP includes APIs and development frameworks for quickly
developing secure and scalable Java EE applications. "`
