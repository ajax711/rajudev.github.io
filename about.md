Hi, I am Raju

I live in different regions of India.
Native of Nagpur, Maharashtra
Currently living in Gurgaon region of Delhi(NCR)

I contribute to various opensource projects in different ways as a coder,
packager, or by talking about them at different conferences and workshops.

I mostly contribute to [Hamara Linux](https://www.hamaralinux.org)and [Debian](https://debian.org)

I also talk and contribute to a lot of other projects such as [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com), [sailfishOS](https://sailfishos.org), etc.

I also have interest in Robotics and have participated in competitions such as [Robocon](https://robocon.net) as a student.
Because of this I have significant expertise with Arduino and different microcontroller boards as well as different [Single Board Computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_board_computer)

I mostly work with Shell scripting and C/C++ and sometimes HTML/css
